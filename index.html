            <p>My name is Jordy Rodriguez. I majored in government with a focus in technology science at Harvard, where I discovered my passion for solving social problems with people-centered solutions. My academic pursuits merged my interest in social impact with my quantitative inclinations, and trained me to critically evaluated the existing paradigm around technology deployment and how it may challenge American values and principles.</p>
            <p>My professional experiences forged me into a generalist, but I have a keen interest in helping growing technology businesses develop, refine, and implement their go-to-market operations. My stint at a TMT-focused strategy consulting firm helped me build a quantitative and qualitative toolkit to solve business challenges collaboratively. My internships and recent advisory roles at HP, Meta, and Aprende Institute have exposed me to the importance of bridging strategy with the client experience and business outcomes - the space where go-to-market teams live. My experiences in technical and client-facing teams help me communicate effectively with diverse team members.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I keep up with psychology and demographic trends. I am currently reading Connected by Nicholas Christakis, and in my free time I’m trying to understand how human-AI interaction is changing socialization and political dynamics. I played club soccer growing up, practiced long-distance running in high school, and now enjoy weightlifting and improving my 5K time. I’m always on the hunt for the best espresso shot (currently Loquat LA).</p>
            <p>I am a practicing Catholic. And in case you were wondering, ¡Hala Madrid!</p>
